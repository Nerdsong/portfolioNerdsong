This application was developed as part of a time-limited technical test with specific requirements. For this project, I used React, JavaScript, and CSS as these are the technologies I'm most experienced with..  

The challenge proved particularly interesting due to the intensive work with mouse events, where I implemented:.  
    • Allowing users to "paint" by holding down and dragging the cursor..  
    • Disabling the right-click (preventing the default context menu)..  
    • A custom contextual menu with a color palette that appears instead..  

To achieve this last feature, I researched coordinate handling using clientX/clientY, enabling dynamic menu positioning based on the cursor location.

Additionally, I optimized the layout using window.innerWidth/innerHeight to generate exactly 100 adaptive square cells fitting the user's screen and ensure they occupied all visible space without overflow, thereby fully meeting the project requirements..  

The result was an intuitive and fluid interface with scalability for new features I plan to implement later.
