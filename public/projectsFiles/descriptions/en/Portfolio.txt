This portfolio itself is one of my largest and most recent projects. It is my first SPA (Single Page Application) built with React and pure CSS. It allowed me to explore other areas of web development, such as design, forms, routing, animations with Lottie files, and develop the identity of my project as a programmer..  

I was able to implement basic hooks like useRef, useState, and useEffect, and experiment with useContext, only to later realize that the latter was not necessary for what I was applying it to. Overall, I faced several challenges during development that helped me solidify my knowledge of React and better understand how this library provides more control over page rendering with the virtual DOM and the differences that arise from this when compared to pure JavaScript development..
