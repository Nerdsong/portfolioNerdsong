This project was born as a response to a need that arose in the company where I work. Without going into too much detail, there was a system change, and we lost a tool that many of us were accustomed to because of the way it displayed information..  
In the new system, we had the option to download an Excel sheet. Starting from the logic that I could convert an Excel file to CSV, in about two weeks, I was able to offer this solution to the problem..  
In this project, aesthetics were not very important, only the organization of the information. Therefore, I used some Bootstrap to shape the cards and content, and the rest was done with JS and HTML. Before that, I had learned about the object-oriented programming paradigm and applied some of it to separate the different entities contained in the Excel data into classes..  
Handling the information presented me with some interesting challenges where I had to learn about sorting algorithms like 'bubble sort' and 'merge sort.' I used the latter to organize the information by date before displaying it in the DOM. Later, I wanted to make some improvements to maintain text notes or other features added to the original elements since I had no way to save the information other than during runtime. To achieve this, I wanted to maintain the information by comparing two blocks of data: the 'current' and the 'new'..  
In summary, this project allowed me to experiment with sorting and comparison algorithms for the first time, as well as apply asynchronous functions, handle entities as objects, and design a solution to a real-world problem..  
I’m leaving two files with which you can test the functionality of the project, along with the deployment and code links. Some features are disabled, as I stopped development since it is no longer essential for the team’s tasks..
